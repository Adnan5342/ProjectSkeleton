Hello and welcome to my project skeleton for MovieMinds Network.

Before getting started, it is important to download my local database file which can be stored anywhere on your computer. To connect to it, 
I use SQL Connect. Please copy and paste the local database path into the SqlConnection line in AdminLogin.aspx.cs (line 21) in the AdminSystem,
replacing it with mine. Please also do the same in lines 31, 70, and 83 in Registration.aspx.cs in the Front-End System as well as line 23 in 
Login.aspx.cs in the Front-End Sytem. Once you are connected in Visual Studio and SQL Connect, and these paths have been replaced, the system 
should be ready to use. 

If using the admin system, I set AdminSystem as the starting project along with AdminLogin.aspx.cs as the starting page. 
If using the front-end system, I set FrontEndSystem as the starting project with Login.aspx.cs or Registration.aspx.cs as the starting page. 

MovieMinds Network is a work in progress, but please try to enjoy using it. Thanks!
Adnan
